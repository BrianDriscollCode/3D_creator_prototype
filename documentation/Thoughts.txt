1. Trying to figure out how to understand the data transfer between
   the different layers. Make list of all variables that transfer 
   between the layers and have to be strict with knowing and 
   mutations between them (have 0 mutations between layers is the goal).

2. Wondering how to manage the render and like Phaser, have a stabilized
   render FPS so that it doesn't require thousands of renders a second. 
   The built-in THREE controllers seems to not have the issue so they
   may explain how THREE handles rendering. 
	
	A) Quick aside: Makes me think about Delta time and applying that
			to the render. 
	B) Does object movement require a rerender? Or can it be done and then
	   render picks up data during current render...
