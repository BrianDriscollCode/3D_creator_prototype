1. Trying to figure out how to understand the data transfer between
   the different layers. Make list of all variables that transfer 
   between the layers and have to be strict with knowing and 
   mutations between them (have 0 mutations between layers is the goal).

2. Wondering how to manage the render and like Phaser, have a stabilized
   render FPS so that it doesn't require thousands of renders a second. 
   The built-in THREE controllers seems to not have the issue so they
   may explain how THREE handles rendering. 
	
	A) Quick aside: Makes me think about Delta time and applying that
			to the render. 
	B) Does object movement require a rerender? Or can it be done and then
	   render picks up data during current render...

3. Figuring out how to get all spawned objects to be spawn on the 
   ground plane. I'm thinking that there will be a need to hardcode
   all objects a spawn height depending on their size.

   a) I can try other equations
   b) Hard code all objects with a specific spawn height 
         choice: *** I am thinking of hardcoding because
                     the circular objects seems to not 
                     work with the "height/2" math that 
                     I'm using.
